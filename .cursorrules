# Cursor Rules for Calunga CLI Project

## Project Overview
This project is converting bash scripts to a modern Python CLI for better testability and maintainability. The CLI manages Calunga - a library of Python packages built from source in Konflux.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: 3.12+ (modern Python with latest features and performance)
- **CLI Framework**: Typer (type-safe, modern, built on Click)
- **Package Management**: Poetry (modern Python dependency management)
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage
- **UI**: Rich (for beautiful terminal output)
- **Code Quality**: black, isort, flake8, mypy

## Development Preferences

### Code Style
- Use black for code formatting (line length: 88)
- Use isort for import sorting (black compatible profile)
- Follow PEP 8 and type hints for all functions
- Use meaningful docstrings for all public functions

### Exception Handling
- **NEVER use broad `try: ... except Exception:` patterns**
- **Let errors propagate by default** - this is safer than silencing errors
- Only catch specific exceptions when you have a meaningful way to handle them
- Common cases where catching specific exceptions is appropriate:
  - `subprocess.CalledProcessError` for subprocess calls that might fail
  - `yaml.YAMLError` for YAML parsing that might be malformed
  - `ValueError`, `TypeError` for data validation with clear recovery
- If you must catch a broad exception, document why and ensure it's truly necessary
- Remember: unexpected errors should propagate to help with debugging

### CLI Development
- Use Typer for all CLI commands
- Use Rich for all user-facing output (panels, console, etc.)
- Always add comprehensive help text for commands
- Structure commands as proper subcommands, not main commands
- Use `no_args_is_help=True` for the main app

### Testing
- Maintain 100% test coverage for all new code
- Use pytest for all tests
- Use Typer's CliRunner for testing CLI commands
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include tests for help text and command registration

### Project Structure
- Source code in `src/calunga/`
- Tests in `tests/`
- Use Poetry for dependency management
- Version information in `src/calunga/__init__.py`

### Git Workflow
- Focus commit messages on "why" not "what"
- Use descriptive commit messages with context
- Run tests before committing
- Keep commits atomic and focused

### When Converting Bash Scripts
1. Analyze the bash script functionality first
2. Create equivalent Python functions with proper error handling
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Maintain backwards compatibility where possible
5. Use Rich for improved user feedback
6. Add proper command-line argument validation
