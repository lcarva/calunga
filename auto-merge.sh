# A script to automatically merge pull requests from a specific bot
# that have successful checks and are mergeable.
#
# SAFETY:
# 1. Runs in DRY RUN mode by default. Use the --execute flag to perform merges.
# 2. Fetches the LATEST check status for each PR individually before merging.
# 3. Checks for merge conflicts before attempting to merge.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./auto_merge.sh               # Dry run: Shows what would be merged.
#   ./auto_merge.sh --execute     # Actually merges the PRs.

# --- Configuration ---
# The username of the bot whose PRs you want to merge.
# BOT_AUTHOR="app/red-hat-konflux-kflux-prd-rh03"
BOT_AUTHOR='app/github-actions'
# The merge strategy to use (--merge, --squash, or --rebase).
MERGE_STRATEGY='--rebase'
# The repository to operate on.
REPO='lcarva/calunga'
